# Quick Fix - Replace Long Lessons

The long lessons might be causing the server to crash. Here's what to do:

## Option 1: Use the backup file I created

I created `fix-lessons.js` with shorter, working lessons.

Run this to see them:
```bash
node fix-lessons.js
```

## Option 2: I'll create a fixed server.js

Let me know and I'll create a version with shorter lessons that will definitely work.

## What's Happening

The comprehensive lessons I added are very long (2000-3000 words each). This might be:
1. Causing memory issues
2. Taking too long to send
3. Having formatting issues

## Quick Test

In your server terminal, do you see:
- "AI explain request received"
- "Topic requested: Motion"
- "Using fallback explanations"
- Then an error?

If so, tell me the error message and I'll fix it immediately!

## Temporary Solution

Want me to replace the long lessons with shorter, working versions? They'll still be educational but won't crash the server.

Just say "yes" and I'll do it right now!
